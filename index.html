				“We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.”WHO cares to admit complete defeat? Practically no one, of course. Every natural instinct cries out against the idea of personal powerlessness. It is
				truly awful to admit that, glass in hand, we have warped our minds into such an ob-session for destructive drinking that only an act of Provi-dence can remove it from us.No other kind of bankruptcy is like this one. Alcohol, now
				become the rapacious creditor, bleeds us of all self-suffi ciency and all will to resist its demands. Once this stark fact is accepted, our bankruptcy as going human concerns is complete.But upon entering A.A. we soon take quite
				another view of this absolute humiliation. We perceive that only through utter defeat are we able to take our fi rst steps toward liber-ation and strength. Our admissions of personal powerless-ness fi nally turn out to be fi rm
				bedrock upon which happy and purposeful lives may be built.We know that little good can come to any alcoholic who joins A.A. unless he has fi rst accepted his devastat-ing weakness and all its consequences. Until he so humbles
				himself, his sobriety—if any—will be precarious. Of real happiness he will fi nd none at all. Proved beyond doubt by an immense experience, this is one of the facts of A.A. life.
			</p>

			<p>
				The principle that we shall fi nd no enduring strength until we fi rst admit complete defeat is the main taproot from which our whole Society has sprung and fl owered.When fi rst challenged to admit defeat, most of us re-volted. We
				had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confi dence. Then we had been told that so far as al-cohol is concerned, self-confi dence was no good whatever; in fact, it was a total liability. Our sponsors declared that we were the
				victims of a mental obsession so subtly pow-erful that no amount of human willpower could break it. There was, they said, no such thing as the personal con-quest of this compulsion by the unaided will. Relentlessly deepening our
				dilemma, our sponsors pointed out our in-creasing sensitivity to alcohol—an allergy, they called it. The tyrant alcohol wielded a double-edged sword over us: fi rst we were smitten by an insane urge that condemned us to go on
				drinking, and then by an allergy of the body that insured we would ultimately destroy ourselves in the process. Few indeed were those who, so assailed, had ever won through in singlehanded combat. It was a statistical fact that
				alcoholics almost never recovered on their own resources. And this had been true, apparently, ever since man had fi rst crushed grapes.In A.A.’s pioneering time, none but the most desperate cases could swallow and digest this
				unpalatable truth. Even these “last-gaspers” often had diffi culty in realizing how hopeless they actually were. But a few did, and when these laid hold of A.A. principles with all the fervor with which the drowning seize life
				preservers, they almost invariably got well. That is why the fi rst edition of the book “Alco-
				STEP ONE23holics Anonymous,” published when our membership was small, dealt with low-bottom cases only.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many less desper-ate alcoholics tried A.A., but did not succeed because they could not make the admission of hopelessness.It is a tremendous satisfaction to record that in the fol-lowing years this changed. Alcoholics who still had
				their health, their families, their jobs, and even two cars in the garage, began to recognize their alcoholism. As this trend grew, they were joined by young people who were scarcely more than potential alcoholics. They were spared
				that last ten or fi fteen years of literal hell the rest of us had gone through. Since Step One requires an admission that our lives have become unmanageable, how could people such as these take this Step?It was obviously necessary to
				raise the bottom the rest of us had hit to the point where it would hit them. By go-ing back in our own drinking histories, we could show that years before we realized it we were out of control, that our drinking even then was no mere
				habit, that it was indeed the beginning of a fatal progression. To the doubters we could say, “Perhaps you’re not an alcoholic after all. Why don’t you try some more controlled drinking, bearing in mind meanwhile what we have told you
				about alcoholism?” This attitude brought immediate and practical results. It was then discovered that when one alcoholic had planted in the mind of another the true nature of his malady, that person could never be the same again.
				Following every spree, he would say to himself, “Maybe those A.A.’s were right....” After a few such experiences, often years before the onset of extreme diffi culties, he would return to us con-
				STEP ONE24vinced. He had hit bottom as truly as any of us. John Bar-leycorn himself had become our best advocate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why all this insistence that every A.A. must hit bottom fi rst? The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A. program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing A.A.’s remaining eleven Steps means the adoption
				of attitudes and actions that almost no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. Who wishes to be rigorously honest and tolerant? Who wants to confess his faults to another and make restitution for harm done? Who cares
				anything about a Higher Power, let alone medi-tation and prayer? Who wants to sacrifi ce time and energy in trying to carry A.A.’s message to the next sufferer? No, the average alcoholic, self-centered in the extreme, doesn’t care for
				this prospect—unless he has to do these things in order to stay alive himself.Under the lash of alcoholism, we are driven to A.A., and there we discover the fatal nature of our situation. Then, and only then, do we become as
				open-minded to conviction and as willing to listen as the dying can be. We stand ready to do anything which will lift the merciless ob-session from us.

				deepened. Relieved of the alcohol obsession, their lives un-accountably transformed, they came to believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of God.”Consider next the plight of those who once had faith, but have lost
				it. There will be those who have drifted into indifference, those fi lled with self-suffi ciency who have cut themselves off, those who have become prejudiced against religion, and those who are downright defi ant because God has
				failed to fulfi ll their demands. Can A.A. experience tell all these they may still fi nd a faith that works?Sometimes A.A. comes harder to those who have lost or rejected faith than to those who never had any faith at all, for they
				think they have tried faith and found it want-ing. They have tried the way of faith and the way of no faith. Since both ways have proved bitterly disappointing, they have concluded there is no place whatever for them to go. The
				roadblocks of indifference, fancied self-suffi ciency, prejudice, and defi ance often prove more solid and formi-dable for these people than any erected by the unconvinced agnostic or even the militant atheist. Religion says the
				ex-istence of God can be proved; the agnostic says it can’t be proved; and the atheist claims proof of the nonexistence of God. Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion. He thinks himself lost to
				the comfort of any conviction at all. He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist. He is the bewildered one.Any number of A.A.’s can say to the drifter, “Yes, we were diverted
				from our childhood faith, too. The overcon-fi dence of youth was too much for us. Of course, we were </p>
			<p>
				glad that good home and religious training had given us certain values. We were still sure that we ought to be fairly honest, tolerant, and just, that we ought to be ambitious and hardworking. We became convinced that such simple
				rules of fair play and decency would be enough.“As material success founded upon no more than these ordinary attributes began to come to us, we felt we were winning at the game of life. This was exhilarating, and it made us happy. Why
				should we be bothered with theologi-cal abstractions and religious duties, or with the state of our souls here or hereafter? The here and now was good enough for us. The will to win would carry us through. But then alcohol began to
				have its way with us. Finally, when all our score cards read ‘zero,’ and we saw that one more strike would put us out of the game forever, we had to look for our lost faith. It was in A.A. that we rediscovered it. And so can you.”Now
				we come to another kind of problem: the intellec-tually self-suffi cient man or woman. To these, many A.A.’s can say, “Yes, we were like you—far too smart for our own good. We loved to have people call us precocious. We used our
				education to blow ourselves up into prideful balloons, though we were careful to hide this from others. Secretly, we felt we could fl oat above the rest of the folks on our brainpower alone. Scientifi c progress told us there was
				nothing man couldn’t do. Knowledge was all-powerful. In-tellect could conquer nature. Since we were brighter than most folks (so we thought), the spoils of victory would be ours for the thinking. The god of intellect displaced the God
				of our fathers. But again John Barleycorn had other

				Made a decision to turn our will and our livesover to the care of God as we understood Him.”PRACTICING Step Three is like the opening of a door which to all appearances is still closed and locked. All we need is a key, and the
				decision to swing the door open. There is only one key, and it is called willingness. Once un-locked by willingness, the door opens almost of itself, and looking through it, we shall see a pathway beside which is an inscription. It
				reads: “This is the way to a faith that works.” In the fi rst two Steps we were engaged in refl ection. We saw that we were powerless over alcohol, but we also perceived that faith of some kind, if only in A.A. itself, is possible to
				anyone. These conclusions did not require ac-tion; they required only acceptance.Like all the remaining Steps, Step Three calls for affi r-mative action, for it is only by action that we can cut away the self-will which has always
				blocked the entry of God—or, if you like, a Higher Power—into our lives. </p>
			<p> Faith, to be sure, is necessary, but faith alone can avail nothing. We can have faith, yet keep God out of our lives. Therefore our problem now becomes just how and by what specifi c means shall we be able to let Him in? Step Three
				represents our fi rst attempt to do this. In fact, the effectiveness of the whole A.A. program will rest upon how well and earnestly we have tried to come to “a decision to turn our will and
				our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.”To every worldly and practical-minded beginner, this Step looks hard, even impossible. No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can he turn his own will and his own life
				over to the care of whatever God he thinks there is? Fortunately, we who have tried it, and with equal misgivings, can testify that anyone, anyone at all, can be-gin to do it. We can further add that a beginning, even the smallest, is
				all that is needed. Once we have placed the key of willingness in the lock and have the door ever so slight-ly open, we fi nd that we can always open it some more. Though self-will may slam it shut again, as it frequently does, it
				will always respond the moment we again pick up the key of willingness.Maybe this all sounds mysterious and remote, some-thing like Einstein’s theory of relativity or a proposition in nuclear physics. It isn’t at all. Let’s look at
				how practical it actually is. </p>
			<p> Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a begin-ning on Step Three. Isn’t it true that in all matters touching upon alcohol, each of them has decided to turn his or her life over to
				the care, protection, and guidance of Alcohol-ics Anonymous? Already a willingness has been achieved to cast out one’s own will and one’s own ideas about the alcohol problem in favor of those suggested by A.A. Any willing newcomer
				feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the foundering vessel he has become. Now if this is not turning one’s will and life over to a newfound Providence, then what is it?But suppose that instinct still cries out, as it certainly
				will,
				Yes, respecting alcohol, I guess I have to be dependent upon A.A.,</p>
			<p> but in all other matters I must still maintain my indepen-dence. Nothing is going to turn me into a nonentity. If I keep on turning my life and my will over to the care of Something or Somebody else, what will become of me? I’ll look
				like the hole in the doughnut.” This, of course, is the process by which in-stinct and logic always seek to bolster egotism, and so frustrate spiritual development. The trouble is that this kind of thinking takes no real account of
				the facts. And the facts seem to be these: The more we become willing to depend upon a Higher Power, the more independent we actually are. Therefore depen-dence, as A.A. practices it, is really a means of gaining true independence of
				the spirit.Let’s examine for a moment this idea of dependence at the level of everyday living. In this area it is startling to dis-cover how dependent we really are, and how unconscious of that dependence. Every modern house has
				electric wir-ing carrying power and light to its interior. We are delight-ed with this dependence; our main hope is that nothing will ever cut off the supply of current. By so accepting our dependence upon this marvel of science, we
				fi nd ourselves more independent personally. Not only are we more inde-pendent, we are even more comfortable and secure. Power fl ows just where it is needed. Silently and surely, electric-ity, that strange energy so few people
				understand, meets our simplest daily needs, and our most desperate ones, too. Ask the polio sufferer confi ned to an iron lung who de-pends with complete trust upon a motor to keep the breath of life in him.But the moment our mental
				or emotional independence
				is in question, how differently we behave.</p>
			<p> How persistently we claim the right to decide all by ourselves just what we shall think and just how we shall act. Oh yes, we’ll weigh the pros and cons of every problem. We’ll listen politely to those who would advise us, but all the
				decisions are to be ours alone. Nobody is going to meddle with our personal independence in such matters. Besides, we think, there is no one we can surely trust. We are certain that our intel-ligence, backed by willpower, can rightly
				control our inner lives and guarantee us success in the world we live in. This brave philosophy, wherein each man plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the acid test: how well does it actually work? One good
				look in the mir-ror ought to be answer enough for any alcoholic.Should his own image in the mirror be too awful to con-template (and it usually is), he might fi rst take a look at the results normal people are getting from self-suffi
				ciency. Everywhere he sees people fi lled with anger and fear, so-ciety breaking up into warring fragments. Each fragment says to the others, “We are right and you are wrong.” Every such pressure group, if it is strong enough,
				self-righteously imposes its will upon the rest. And everywhere the same thing is being done on an individual basis. The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less brotherhood than before. The philosophy of self-suffi ciency
				is not paying off. Plainly enough, it is a bone-crushing juggernaut whose fi -nal achievement is ruin.Therefore, we who are alcoholics can consider ourselves fortunate indeed. Each of us has had his own near-fatal en-counter with the
				juggernaut of self-will, and has suffered
				enough under its weight to be willing to look for some-thing better. </p>
			<p> So it is by circumstance rather than by any virtue that we have been driven to A.A., have admitted de-feat, have acquired the rudiments of faith, and now want to make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to a Higher Power.We
				realize that the word “dependence” is as distasteful to many psychiatrists and psychologists as it is to alcohol-ics. Like our professional friends, we, too, are aware that there are wrong forms of dependence. We have experienced many
				of them. No adult man or woman, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a par-ent. They should have been weaned long before, and if they have not been, they should wake up to the fact. This very form of faulty
				dependence has caused many a rebellious alcoholic to conclude that dependence of any sort must be intolerably damaging. But dependence upon an A.A. group or upon a Higher Power hasn’t produced any baleful results.When World War II
				broke out, this spiritual principle had its fi rst major test. A.A.’s entered the services and were scattered all over the world. Would they be able to take discipline, stand up under fi re, and endure the monotony and misery of war?
				Would the kind of dependence they had learned in A.A. carry them through? Well, it did. They had even fewer alcoholic lapses or emotional binges than A.A.’s safe at home did. They were just as capable of en-durance and valor as any
				other soldiers. Whether in Alas-ka or on the Salerno beachhead, their dependence upon a Higher Power worked. And far from being a weakness, </p>
			<p>this
				dependence was their chief source of strength.So how, exactly, can the willing person continue to turn his will and his life over to the Higher Power? He made a beginning, we have seen, when he commenced to rely upon A.A. for the
				solution of his alcohol problem. By now, though, the chances are that he has become convinced that he has more problems than alcohol, and that some of these refuse to be solved by all the sheer personal determination and courage he
				can muster. They simply will not budge; they make him desperately unhappy and threaten his new-found sobriety. Our friend is still victimized by remorse and guilt when he thinks of yesterday. Bitterness still overpow-ers him when he
				broods upon those he still envies or hates. His fi nancial insecurity worries him sick, and panic takes over when he thinks of all the bridges to safety that alcohol burned behind him. And how shall he ever straighten out that awful
				jam that cost him the affection of his family and separated him from them? His lone courage and unaided will cannot do it. Surely he must now depend upon Some-body or Something else.At fi rst that “somebody” is likely to be his
				closest A.A. friend. He relies upon the assurance that his many trou-bles, now made more acute because he cannot use alcohol to kill the pain, can be solved, too. Of course the sponsor points out that our friend’s life is still
				unmanageable even though he is sober, that after all, only a bare start on A.A.’s program has been made. More sobriety brought about by the admission of alcoholism and by attendance at a few meetings is very good indeed, but it is
				bound to be a far cry from permanent sobriety and a contented, useful life.</p>
			<p>That is just where the remaining Steps of the A.A. program come in. Nothing short of continuous action upon these as a way of life can bring the much-desired result.Then it is explained that other Steps of the A.A. pro-gram can be
				practiced with success only when Step Three is given a determined and persistent trial. This statement may surprise newcomers who have experienced noth-ing but constant defl ation and a growing conviction that human will is of no
				value whatever. They have become persuaded, and rightly so, that many problems besides alcohol will not yield to a headlong assault powered by the individual alone. But now it appears that there are cer-tain things which only the
				individual can do. All by him-self, and in the light of his own circumstances, he needs to develop the quality of willingness. When he acquires willingness, he is the only one who can make the decision to exert himself. Trying to do
				this is an act of his own will. All of the Twelve Steps require sustained and personal exertion to conform to their principles and so, we trust, to God’s will.It is when we try to make our will conform with God’s that we begin to use
				it rightly. To all of us, this was a most wonderful revelation. Our whole trouble had been the mis-use of willpower. We had tried to bombard our problems with it instead of attempting to bring it into agreement with God’s intention
				for us. To make this increasingly possible is the purpose of A.A.’s Twelve Steps, and Step Three opens the door.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once we have come into agreement with these ideas, it is really easy to begin the practice of Step Three. In all times
				of emotional disturbance or indecision, we can pause, ask for quiet, and in the stillness simply say: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the
				differ-ence. Thy will, not mine, be done.”

				hurdles, the course ahead began to look easier. For we had started to get perspective on ourselves, which is another way of saying that we were gaining in humility.Of course the depressive and the power-driver are per-sonality
				extremes, types with which A.A. and the whole world abound. Often these personalities are just as sharply defi ned as the examples given. But just as often some of us will fi t more or less into both classifi cations. Human beings are
				never quite alike, so each of us, when making an inven-tory, will need to determine what his individual character defects are. Having found the shoes that fi t, he ought to step into them and walk with new confi dence that he is at
				last on the right track.Now let’s ponder the need for a list of the more glaring personality defects all of us have in varying degrees. To those having religious training, such a list would set forth serious violations of moral
				principles. Some others will think of this list as defects of character. Still others will call it an index of maladjustments. Some will become quite annoyed if there is talk about immorality, let alone sin. But all who are in the
				least reasonable will agree upon one point: that there is plenty wrong with us alcoholics about which plenty will have to be done if we are to expect sobri-ety, progress, and any real ability to cope with life.To avoid falling into
				confusion over the names these de-fects should be called, let’s take a universally recognized list of major human failings—the Seven Deadly Sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. It is not by accident that pride
				heads the procession. For pride, lead-ing to self-justifi cation, and always spurred by conscious
				or unconscious fears, is the basic breeder of most human diffi culties, the chief block to true progress. Pride lures us into making demands upon ourselves or upon others which cannot be met without perverting or misusing our
				God-given instincts. When the satisfaction of our instincts for sex, security, and society becomes the sole object of our lives, then pride steps in to justify our excesses.All these failings generate fear, a soul-sickness in its own
				right. Then fear, in turn, generates more character defects. Unreasonable fear that our instincts will not be satisfi ed drives us to covet the possessions of others, to lust for sex and power, to become angry when our instinctive
				demands are threatened, to be envious when the ambitions of others seem to be realized while ours are not. We eat, drink, and grab for more of everything than we need, fearing we shall never have enough. And with genuine alarm at the
				pros-pect of work, we stay lazy. We loaf and procrastinate, or at best work grudgingly and under half steam. These fears are the termites that ceaselessly devour the foundations of whatever sort of life we try to build.So when A.A.
				suggests a fearless moral inventory, it must seem to every newcomer that more is being asked of him than he can do. Both his pride and his fear beat him back every time he tries to look within himself. Pride says, “You need not pass
				this way,” and Fear says, “You dare not look!” But the testimony of A.A.’s who have really tried a moral inventory is that pride and fear of this sort turn out to be bogeymen, nothing else. Once we have a com-plete willingness to take
				inventory, and exert ourselves to do the job thoroughly, a wonderful light falls upon this

				we are to confide. Here we ought to take much care, remem-bering that prudence is a virtue which carries a high rating. Perhaps we shall need to share with this person facts about ourselves which no others ought to know. We shall want
				to speak with someone who is experienced, who not only has stayed dry but has been able to surmount other serious diffi culties. Diffi culties, perhaps, like our own. This person may turn out to be one’s sponsor, but not necessarily
				so. If you have developed a high confi dence in him, and his tem-perament and problems are close to your own, then such a choice will be good. Besides, your sponsor already has the advantage of knowing something about your
				case.Perhaps, though, your relation to him is such that you would care to reveal only a part of your story. If this is the situation, by all means do so, for you ought to make a beginning as soon as you can. It may turn out, however,
				that you’ll choose someone else for the more diffi cult and deeper revelations. This individual may be entirely outside of A.A. —for example, your clergyman or your doctor. For some of us, a complete stranger may prove the best
				bet.The real tests of the situation are your own willingness to confi de and your full confi dence in the one with whom you share your fi rst accurate self-survey. Even when you’ve found the person, it frequently takes great
				resolution to ap-proach him or her. No one ought to say the A.A. program requires no willpower; here is one place you may require all you’ve got. Happily, though, the chances are that you will be in for a very pleasant surprise. When
				your mission is carefully explained, and it is seen by the recipient of your confi dence how helpful he can really be, the conversation
				will start easily and will soon become eager. Before long, your listener may well tell a story or two about himself which will place you even more at ease. Provided you hold back nothing, your sense of relief will mount from min-ute
				to minute. The dammed-up emotions of years break out of their confi nement, and miraculously vanish as soon as they are exposed. As the pain subsides, a healing tran-quillity takes its place. And when humility and serenity are so
				combined, something else of great moment is apt to occur. Many an A.A., once agnostic or atheistic, tells us that it was during this stage of Step Five that he fi rst ac-tually felt the presence of God. And even those who had faith
				already often become conscious of God as they never were before.This feeling of being at one with God and man, this emerging from isolation through the open and honest shar-ing of our terrible burden of guilt, brings us to a resting
				place where we may prepare ourselves for the following Steps toward a full and meaningful sobriety.

				“Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.”“THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.” So declares a well-loved clergyman who happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends. He goes on to
				explain that any person capable of enough willingness and honesty to try re-peatedly Step Six on all his faults—without any reservations whatever—has indeed come a long way spiritually, and is therefore entitled to be called a man who
				is sincerely trying to grow in the image and likeness of his own Creator.Of course, the often disputed question of whether God can—and will, under certain conditions—remove defects of character will be answered with a prompt affi
				rmative by almost any A.A. member. To him, this proposition will be no theory at all; it will be just about the largest fact in his life. He will usually offer his proof in a statement like this:“Sure, I was beaten, absolutely licked.
				My own will-power just wouldn’t work on alcohol. Change of scene, the best efforts of family, friends, doctors, and clergymen got no place with my alcoholism. I simply couldn’t stop drink-ing, and no human being could seem to do the
				job for me. But when I became willing to clean house and then asked a Higher Power, God as I understood Him, to give me re-lease, my obsession to drink vanished. It was lifted right out of me.”
				In A.A. meetings all over the world, statements just like this are heard daily. It is plain for everybody to see that each sober A.A. member has been granted a release from this very obstinate and potentially fatal obsession. So in a
				very complete and literal way, all A.A.’s have “become entirely ready” to have God remove the mania for alcohol from their lives. And God has proceeded to do exactly that.Having been granted a perfect release from alcoholism, why then
				shouldn’t we be able to achieve by the same means a perfect release from every other diffi culty or defect? This is a riddle of our existence, the full answer to which may be only in the mind of God. Nevertheless, at least a part of
				the answer to it is apparent to us.When men and women pour so much alcohol into them-selves that they destroy their lives, they commit a most un-natural act. Defying their instinctive desire for self-preser-vation, they seem bent upon
				self-destruction. They work against their own deepest instinct. As they are humbled by the terrifi c beating administered by alcohol, the grace of God can enter them and expel their obsession. Here their powerful instinct to live can
				cooperate fully with their Creator’s desire to give them new life. For nature and God alike abhor suicide.But most of our other diffi culties don’t fall under such a category at all. Every normal person wants, for example, to eat, to
				reproduce, to be somebody in the society of his fellows. And he wishes to be reasonably safe and secure as he tries to attain these things. Indeed, God made him that way. He did not design man to destroy himself by alcohol, but He did
				give man instincts to help him to stay alive.
				It is nowhere evident, at least in this life, that our Cre-ator expects us fully to eliminate our instinctual drives. So far as we know, it is nowhere on the record that God has completely removed from any human being all his natural
				drives.Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires, it isn’t strange that we often let these far exceed their intended purpose. When they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that they supply us with more
				satisfac-tions or pleasures than are possible or due us, that is the point at which we depart from the degree of perfection that God wishes for us here on earth. That is the measure of our character defects, or, if you wish, of our
				sins.If we ask, God will certainly forgive our derelictions. But in no case does He render us white as snow and keep us that way without our cooperation. That is something we are supposed to be willing to work toward ourselves. He
				asks only that we try as best we know how to make prog-ress in the building of character.So Step Six—“Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character”—is A.A.’s way of stating the best possible attitude one can
				take in order to make a beginning on this lifetime job. This does not mean that we expect all our character defects to be lifted out of us as the drive to drink was. A few of them may be, but with most of them we shall have to be
				content with patient improvement. The key words “entirely ready” underline the fact that we want to aim at the very best we know or can learn.How many of us have this degree of readiness? In an ab-solute sense practically nobody has
				it. The best we can do,
				with all the honesty that we can summon, is to try to have it. Even then the best of us will discover to our dismay that there is always a sticking point, a point at which we say, “No, I can’t give this up yet.” And we shall often
				tread on even more dangerous ground when we cry, “This I will nev-er give up!” Such is the power of our instincts to overreach themselves. No matter how far we have progressed, desires will always be found which oppose the grace of
				God.Some who feel they have done well may dispute this, so let’s try to think it through a little further. Practically every-body wishes to be rid of his most glaring and destructive handicaps. No one wants to be so proud that he is
				scorned as a braggart, nor so greedy that he is labeled a thief. No one wants to be angry enough to murder, lustful enough to rape, gluttonous enough to ruin his health. No one wants to be agonized by the chronic pain of envy or to be
				para-lyzed by sloth. Of course, most human beings don’t suffer these defects at these rock-bottom levels.We who have escaped these extremes are apt to congrat-ulate ourselves. Yet can we? After all, hasn’t it been self-interest, pure
				and simple, that has enabled most of us to escape? Not much spiritual effort is involved in avoiding excesses which will bring us punishment anyway. But when we face up to the less violent aspects of these very same defects, then
				where do we stand?What we must recognize now is that we exult in some of our defects. We really love them. Who, for example, doesn’t like to feel just a little superior to the next fellow, or even quite a lot superior? Isn’t it true
				that we like to let greed masquerade as ambition? To think of liking lust seems im-
				possible. But how many men and women speak love with their lips, and believe what they say, so that they can hide lust in a dark corner of their minds? And even while stay-ing within conventional bounds, many people have to ad-mit
				that their imaginary sex excursions are apt to be all dressed up as dreams of romance.Self-righteous anger also can be very enjoyable. In a perverse way we can actually take satisfaction from the fact that many people annoy us, for it
				brings a comfortable feeling of superiority. Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too. Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to
				proclaim our own righ-teousness.When gluttony is less than ruinous, we have a milder word for that, too; we call it “taking our comfort.” We live in a world riddled with envy. To a greater or less degree, ev-erybody is infected with
				it. From this defect we must surely get a warped yet defi nite satisfaction. Else why would we consume such great amounts of time wishing for what we have not, rather than working for it, or angrily looking for attributes we shall
				never have, instead of adjusting to the fact, and accepting it? And how often we work hard with no better motive than to be secure and slothful later on— only we call that “retiring.” Consider, too, our talents for procrastination,
				which is really sloth in fi ve syllables. Near-ly anyone could submit a good list of such defects as these, and few of us would seriously think of giving them up, at least until they cause us excessive misery.Some people, of course,
				may conclude that they are in-
				deed ready to have all such defects taken from them. But even these people, if they construct a list of still milder defects, will be obliged to admit that they prefer to hang on to some of them. Therefore, it seems plain that few of
				us can quickly or easily become ready to aim at spiritual and moral perfection; we want to settle for only as much perfection as will get us by in life, according, of course, to our various and sundry ideas of what will get us by. So
				the difference between “the boys and the men” is the difference between striving for a self-determined objective and for the perfect objective which is of God.Many will at once ask, “How can we accept the entire implication of Step
				Six? Why—that is perfection!” This sounds like a hard question, but practically speaking, it isn’t. Only Step One, where we made the 100 percent ad-mission we were powerless over alcohol, can be practiced with absolute perfection. The
				remaining eleven Steps state perfect ideals. They are goals toward which we look, and the measuring sticks by which we estimate our progress. Seen in this light, Step Six is still diffi cult, but not at all impossible. The only urgent
				thing is that we make a begin-ning, and keep trying.If we would gain any real advantage in the use of this Step on problems other than alcohol, we shall need to make a brand new venture into open-mindedness. We shall need to raise our
				eyes toward perfection, and be ready to walk in that direction. It will seldom matter how haltingly we walk. The only question will be “Are we ready?”Looking again at those defects we are still unwilling to give up, we ought to erase
				the hard-and-fast lines that we
				have drawn. Perhaps we shall be obliged in some cases still to say, “This I cannot give up yet...,” but we should not say to ourselves, “This I will never give up!”Let’s dispose of what appears to be a hazardous open end we have left.
				It is suggested that we ought to become entirely willing to aim toward perfection. We note that some delay, however, might be pardoned. That word, in the mind of a rationalizing alcoholic, could certainly be given a long-term meaning.
				He could say, “How very easy! Sure, I’ll head toward perfection, but I’m certainly not going to hurry any. Maybe I can postpone dealing with some of my problems indefi nitely.” Of course, this won’t do. Such a bluffi ng of oneself
				will have to go the way of many another pleasant rationalization. At the very least, we shall have to come to grips with some of our worst character defects and take action toward their removal as quickly as we can.The moment we say,
				“No, never!” our minds close against the grace of God. Delay is dangerous, and rebellion may be fatal. This is the exact point at which we abandon limited objectives, and move toward God’s will for us.

				“Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcom-ings.” SINCE this Step so specifi cally concerns itself with hu-mility, we should pause here to consider what humility is and what the practice of it can mean to us.Indeed, the attainment of
				greater humility is the founda-tion principle of each of A.A.’s Twelve Steps. For without some degree of humility, no alcoholic can stay sober at all. Nearly all A.A.’s have found, too, that unless they develop much more of this
				precious quality than may be required just for sobriety, they still haven’t much chance of becom-ing truly happy. Without it, they cannot live to much useful purpose, or, in adversity, be able to summon the faith that can meet any
				emergency.Humility, as a word and as an ideal, has a very bad time of it in our world. Not only is the idea misunderstood; the word itself is often intensely disliked. Many people haven’t even a nodding acquaintance with humility as a
				way of life. Much of the everyday talk we hear, and a great deal of what we read, highlights man’s pride in his own achievements.With great intelligence, men of science have been forcing nature to disclose her secrets. The immense
				resources now being harnessed promise such a quantity of material bless-ings that many have come to believe that a man-made mil-lennium lies just ahead. Poverty will disappear, and there
				will be such abundance that everybody can have all the security and personal satisfactions he desires. The theory seems to be that once everybody’s primary instincts are sat-isfi ed, there won’t be much left to quarrel about. The
				world will then turn happy and be free to concentrate on culture and character. Solely by their own intelligence and labor, men will have shaped their own destiny.Certainly no alcoholic, and surely no member of A.A., wants to
				deprecate material achievement. Nor do we enter into debate with the many who still so passionately cling to the belief that to satisfy our basic natural desires is the main object of life. But we are sure that no class of people in
				the world ever made a worse mess of trying to live by this formula than alcoholics. For thousands of years we have been demanding more than our share of security, prestige, and romance. When we seemed to be succeeding, we drank to
				dream still greater dreams. When we were frus-trated, even in part, we drank for oblivion. Never was there enough of what we thought we wanted.In all these strivings, so many of them well-intentioned, our crippling handicap had been
				our lack of humility. We had lacked the perspective to see that character-building and spiritual values had to come fi rst, and that material satisfactions were not the purpose of living. Quite char-acteristically, we had gone all out
				in confusing the ends with the means. Instead of regarding the satisfaction of our material desires as the means by which we could live and function as human beings, we had taken these satisfac-tions to be the fi nal end and aim of
				life.True, most of us thought good character was desirable,
				but obviously good character was something one needed to get on with the business of being self-satisfi ed. With a proper display of honesty and morality, we’d stand a better chance of getting what we really wanted. But whenever we
				had to choose between character and comfort, the charac-ter-building was lost in the dust of our chase after what we thought was happiness. Seldom did we look at charac-ter-building as something desirable in itself, something we would
				like to strive for whether our instinctual needs were met or not. We never thought of making honesty, tolerance, and true love of man and God the daily basis of living.This lack of anchorage to any permanent values, this blindness to
				the true purpose of our lives, produced an-other bad result. For just so long as we were convinced that we could live exclusively by our own individual strength and intelligence, for just that long was a working faith in a Higher
				Power impossible. This was true even when we believed that God existed. We could actually have earnest religious beliefs which remained barren because we were still trying to play God ourselves. As long as we placed self-reliance fi
				rst, a genuine reliance upon a Higher Power was out of the question. That basic ingredient of all humility, a desire to seek and do God’s will, was missing.For us, the process of gaining a new perspective was unbelievably painful. It
				was only by repeated humiliations that we were forced to learn something about humility. It was only at the end of a long road, marked by successive defeats and humiliations, and the fi nal crushing of our self-suffi ciency, that we
				began to feel humility as some-thing more than a condition of groveling despair. Every
				newcomer in Alcoholics Anonymous is told, and soon real-izes for himself, that his humble admission of powerlessness over alcohol is his fi rst step toward liberation from its para-lyzing grip.So it is that we fi rst see humility as a
				necessity. But this is the barest beginning. To get completely away from our aversion to the idea of being humble, to gain a vision of humility as the avenue to true freedom of the human spirit, to be willing to work for humility as
				something to be de-sired for itself, takes most of us a long, long time. A whole lifetime geared to self-centeredness cannot be set in reverse all at once. Rebellion dogs our every step at fi rst.When we have fi nally admitted without
				reservation that we are powerless over alcohol, we are apt to breathe a great sigh of relief, saying, “Well, thank God that’s over! I’ll never have to go through that again!” Then we learn, often to our consternation, that this is
				only the first milestone on the new road we are walking. Still goaded by sheer necessity, we re-luctantly come to grips with those serious character fl aws that made problem drinkers of us in the fi rst place, fl aws which must be
				dealt with to prevent a retreat into alcohol-ism once again. We will want to be rid of some of these defects, but in some instances this will appear to be an im-possible job from which we recoil. And we cling with a pas-sionate
				persistence to others which are just as disturbing to our equilibrium, because we still enjoy them too much. How can we possibly summon the resolution and the willingness to get rid of such overwhelming compulsions and desires?But
				again we are driven on by the inescapable conclusion which we draw from A.A. experience, that we surely must

				“Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.”STEPS Eight and Nine are concerned with personal rela-tions. First, we take a look backward and try to discover where we have been at fault;
				next we make a vigorous at-tempt to repair the damage we have done; and third, hav-ing thus cleaned away the debris of the past, we consider how, with our newfound knowledge of ourselves, we may develop the best possible relations
				with every human being we know.This is a very large order. It is a task which we may per-form with increasing skill, but never really fi nish. Learning how to live in the greatest peace, partnership, and brother-hood with all men and
				women, of whatever description, is a moving and fascinating adventure. Every A.A. has found that he can make little headway in this new adventure of living until he fi rst backtracks and really makes an accu-rate and unsparing survey
				of the human wreckage he has left in his wake. To a degree, he has already done this when taking moral inventory, but now the time has come when he ought to redouble his efforts to see how many people he has hurt, and in what ways.
				This reopening of emotional wounds, some old, some perhaps forgotten, and some still painfully festering, will at fi rst look like a purposeless and pointless piece of surgery. But if a willing start is made,
				then the great advantages of doing this will so quickly re-veal themselves that the pain will be lessened as one ob-stacle after another melts away.These obstacles, however, are very real. The fi rst, and one of the most diffi cult,
				has to do with forgiveness. The mo-ment we ponder a twisted or broken relationship with an-other person, our emotions go on the defensive. To escape looking at the wrongs we have done another, we resentfully focus on the wrong he has
				done us. This is especially true if he has, in fact, behaved badly at all. Triumphantly we seize upon his misbehavior as the perfect excuse for minimizing or forgetting our own.Right here we need to fetch ourselves up sharply. It
				doesn’t make much sense when a real tosspot calls a kettle black. Let’s remember that alcoholics are not the only ones bedeviled by sick emotions. Moreover, it is usually a fact that our behavior when drinking has aggravated the
				defects of others. We’ve repeatedly strained the patience of our best friends to a snapping point, and have brought out the very worst in those who didn’t think much of us to begin with. In many instances we are really dealing with
				fellow sufferers, people whose woes we have increased. If we are now about to ask forgiveness for ourselves, why shouldn’t we start out by forgiving them, one and all?When listing the people we have harmed, most of us hit another
				solid obstacle. We got a pretty severe shock when we realized that we were preparing to make a face-to-face admission of our wretched conduct to those we had hurt. It had been embarrassing enough when in confi dence we had admitted
				these things to God, to ourselves, and to another
				human being. But the prospect of actually visiting or even writing the people concerned now overwhelmed us, espe-cially when we remembered in what poor favor we stood with most of them. There were cases, too, where we had damaged
				others who were still happily unaware of being hurt. Why, we cried, shouldn’t bygones be bygones? Why do we have to think of these people at all? These were some of the ways in which fear conspired with pride to hinder our making a
				list of all the people we had harmed.Some of us, though, tripped over a very different snag. We clung to the claim that when drinking we never hurt anybody but ourselves. Our families didn’t suffer, because we always paid the bills
				and seldom drank at home. Our business associates didn’t suffer, because we were usually on the job. Our reputations hadn’t suffered, because we were certain few knew of our drinking. Those who did would sometimes assure us that,
				after all, a lively bender was only a good man’s fault. What real harm, therefore, had we done? No more, surely, than we could easily mend with a few casual apologies.This attitude, of course, is the end result of purposeful
				forgetting. It is an attitude which can only be changed by a deep and honest search of our motives and actions.Though in some cases we cannot make restitution at all, and in some cases action ought to be deferred, we should
				nevertheless make an accurate and really exhaustive survey of our past life as it has affected other people. In many in-stances we shall fi nd that though the harm done others has not been great, the emotional harm we have done
				ourselves has. Very deep, sometimes quite forgotten, damaging emo-
				tional confl icts persist below the level of consciousness. At the time of these occurrences, they may actually have given our emotions violent twists which have since discolored our personalities and altered our lives for the
				worse.While the purpose of making restitution to others is paramount, it is equally necessary that we extricate from an examination of our personal relations every bit of in-formation about ourselves and our fundamental diffi cul-ties
				that we can. Since defective relations with other human beings have nearly always been the immediate cause of our woes, including our alcoholism, no fi eld of investigation could yield more satisfying and valuable rewards than this
				one. Calm, thoughtful refl ection upon personal relations can deepen our insight. We can go far beyond those things which were superfi cially wrong with us, to see those fl aws which were basic, fl aws which sometimes were responsible
				for the whole pattern of our lives. Thoroughness, we have found, will pay—and pay handsomely.We might next ask ourselves what we mean when we say that we have “harmed” other people. What kinds of “harm” do people do one another,
				anyway? To defi ne the word “harm” in a practical way, we might call it the re-sult of instincts in collision, which cause physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual damage to people. If our tempers are consistently bad, we arouse
				anger in others. If we lie or cheat, we deprive others not only of their worldly goods, but of their emotional security and peace of mind. We re-ally issue them an invitation to become contemptuous and vengeful. If our sex conduct is
				selfi sh, we may excite jeal-ousy, misery, and a strong desire to retaliate in kind.

				meeting, or perhaps after we have fi nished reading the book “Alcoholics Anonymous,” we usually want to sit down with some member of the family and readily admit the damage we have done by our drinking. Almost always we want to go
				further and admit other defects that have made us hard to live with. This will be a very different occasion, and in sharp contrast with those hangover mornings when we al-ternated between reviling ourselves and blaming the family (and
				everyone else) for our troubles. At this fi rst sitting, it is necessary only that we make a general admission of our defects. It may be unwise at this stage to rehash certain har-rowing episodes. Good judgment will suggest that we
				ought to take our time. While we may be quite willing to reveal the very worst, we must be sure to remember that we cannot buy our own peace of mind at the expense of others.Much the same approach will apply at the offi ce or
				fac-tory. We shall at once think of a few people who know all about our drinking, and who have been most affected by it. But even in these cases, we may need to use a little more dis-cretion than we did with the family. We may not
				want to say anything for several weeks, or longer. First we will wish to be reasonably certain that we are on the A.A. beam. Then we are ready to go to these people, to tell them what A.A. is, and what we are trying to do. Against
				this background we can freely admit the damage we have done and make our apologies. We can pay, or promise to pay, whatever obliga-tions, fi nancial or otherwise, we owe. The generous response of most people to such quiet sincerity
				will often astonish us. Even our severest and most justifi ed critics will frequently meet us more than halfway on the fi rst trial.
				This atmosphere of approval and praise is apt to be so exhilarating as to put us off balance by creating an insa-tiable appetite for more of the same. Or we may be tipped over in the other direction when, in rare cases, we get a cool
				and skeptical reception. This will tempt us to argue, or to press our point insistently. Or maybe it will tempt us to discouragement and pessimism. But if we have prepared ourselves well in advance, such reactions will not defl ect us
				from our steady and even purpose.After taking this preliminary trial at making amends, we may enjoy such a sense of relief that we conclude our task is fi nished. We will want to rest on our laurels. The temp-tation to skip the more
				humiliating and dreaded meetings that still remain may be great. We will often manufacture plausible excuses for dodging these issues entirely. Or we may just procrastinate, telling ourselves the time is not yet, when in reality we
				have already passed up many a fi ne chance to right a serious wrong. Let’s not talk prudence while practicing evasion.As soon as we begin to feel confi dent in our new way of life and have begun, by our behavior and example, to
				convince those about us that we are indeed changing for the better, it is usually safe to talk in complete frankness with those who have been seriously affected, even those who may be only a little or not at all aware of what we have
				done to them. The only exceptions we will make will be cases where our disclosure would cause actual harm. These conversations can begin in a casual or natural way. But if no such opportunity presents itself, at some point we will
				want to summon all our courage, head straight for the per-
				son concerned, and lay our cards on the table. We needn’t wallow in excessive remorse before those we have harmed, but amends at this level should always be forthright and generous.There can only be one consideration which should
				qual-ify our desire for a complete disclosure of the damage we have done. That will arise in the occasional situation where to make a full revelation would seriously harm the one to whom we are making amends. Or—quite as important—
				other people. We cannot, for example, unload a detailed account of extramarital adventuring upon the shoulders of our unsuspecting wife or husband. And even in those cases where such a matter must be discussed, let’s try to avoid
				harming third parties, whoever they may be. It does not lighten our burden when we recklessly make the crosses of others heavier.Many a razor-edged question can arise in other depart-ments of life where this same principle is
				involved. Sup-pose, for instance, that we have drunk up a good chunk of our fi rm’s money, whether by “borrowing” or on a heavily padded expense account. Suppose that this may continue to go undetected, if we say nothing. Do we
				instantly con-fess our irregularities to the fi rm, in the practical certainty that we will be fi red and become unemployable? Are we going to be so rigidly righteous about making amends that we don’t care what happens to the family
				and home? Or do we fi rst consult those who are to be gravely affected? Do we lay the matter before our sponsor or spiritual adviser, earnestly asking God’s help and guidance—meanwhile re-solving to do the right thing when it becomes
				clear, cost

				need to wander morbidly around in the past. It requires an admission and correction of errors now. Our inventory enables us to settle with the past. When this is done, we are really able to leave it behind us. When our inventory is
				carefully taken, and we have made peace with ourselves, the conviction follows that tomorrow’s challenges can be met as they come.Although all inventories are alike in principle, the time factor does distinguish one from another.
				There’s the spot-check inventory, taken at any time of the day, whenever we fi nd ourselves getting tangled up. There’s the one we take at day’s end, when we review the happenings of the hours just past. Here we cast up a balance
				sheet, crediting ourselves with things well done, and chalking up debits where due. Then there are those occasions when alone, or in the com-pany of our sponsor or spiritual adviser, we make a careful review of our progress since the
				last time. Many A.A.’s go in for annual or semiannual housecleanings. Many of us also like the experience of an occasional retreat from the outside world where we can quiet down for an undisturbed day or so of self-overhaul and
				meditation.Aren’t these practices joy-killers as well as time-consum-ers? Must A.A.’s spend most of their waking hours drea-rily rehashing their sins of omission or commission? Well, hardly. The emphasis on inventory is heavy only
				because a great many of us have never really acquired the habit of accurate self-appraisal. Once this healthy practice has be-come grooved, it will be so interesting and profi table that the time it takes won’t be missed. For these
				minutes and sometimes hours spent in self-examination are bound to
				make all the other hours of our day better and happier. And at length our inventories become a regular part of ev-eryday living, rather than something unusual or set apart.Before we ask what a spot-check inventory is, let’s look at
				the kind of setting in which such an inventory can do its work.It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us. If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the
				wrong also. But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about “justifi able” anger? If somebody cheats us, aren’t we entitled to be mad? Can’t we be properly angry with self-righteous folk? For us of A.A. these are dangerous
				excep-tions. We have found that justifi ed anger ought to be left to those better qualifi ed to handle it.Few people have been more victimized by resentments than have we alcoholics. It mattered little whether our re-sentments were
				justifi ed or not. A burst of temper could spoil a day, and a well-nursed grudge could make us mis-erably ineffective. Nor were we ever skillful in separating justifi ed from unjustifi ed anger. As we saw it, our wrath was always
				justifi ed. Anger, that occasional luxury of more balanced people, could keep us on an emotional jag indefi -nitely. These emotional “dry benders” often led straight to the bottle. Other kinds of disturbances—jealousy, envy,
				self-pity, or hurt pride—did the same thing.A spot-check inventory taken in the midst of such dis-turbances can be of very great help in quieting stormy emotions. Today’s spot check fi nds its chief application to situations which
				arise in each day’s march.
				The consideration of long-standing diffi culties had better be postponed, when possible, to times deliberately set aside for that pur-pose. The quick inventory is aimed at our daily ups and downs, especially those where people or new
				events throw us off balance and tempt us to make mistakes.In all these situations we need self-restraint, honest analysis of what is involved, a willingness to admit when the fault is ours, and an equal willingness to forgive when the
				fault is elsewhere. We need not be discouraged when we fall into the error of our old ways, for these disciplines are not easy. We shall look for progress, not for perfection.Our fi rst objective will be the development of
				self-re-straint. This carries a top priority rating. When we speak or act hastily or rashly, the ability to be fair-minded and tolerant evaporates on the spot. One unkind tirade or one willful snap judgment can ruin our relation with
				another person for a whole day, or maybe a whole year. Noth-ing pays off like restraint of tongue and pen. We must avoid quick-tempered criticism and furious, power-driv-en argument. The same goes for sulking or silent scorn. These
				are emotional booby traps baited with pride and vengefulness. Our fi rst job is to sidestep the traps. When we are tempted by the bait, we should train ourselves to step back and think. For we can neither think nor act to good purpose
				until the habit of self-restraint has become automatic.Disagreeable or unexpected problems are not the only ones that call for self-control. We must be quite as care-ful when we begin to achieve some measure of importance and material
				success. For no people have ever loved per-

				which “proved” there was no God whatever. What about all the accidents, sickness, cruelty, and injustice in the world? What about all those unhappy lives which were the direct result of unfortunate birth and uncontrollable
				cir-cumstances? Surely there could be no justice in this scheme of things, and therefore no God at all.Sometimes we took a slightly different tack. Sure, we said to ourselves, the hen probably did come before the egg. No doubt the
				universe had a “fi rst cause” of some sort, the God of the Atom, maybe, hot and cold by turns. But certainly there wasn’t any evidence of a God who knew or cared about human beings. We liked A.A. all right, and were quick to say that
				it had done miracles. But we recoiled from meditation and prayer as obstinately as the scientist who refused to perform a certain experiment lest it prove his pet theory wrong. Of course we fi nally did experiment, and when unexpected
				results followed, we felt different; in fact we knew different; and so we were sold on meditation and prayer. And that, we have found, can happen to anybody who tries. It has been well said that “almost the only scoffers at prayer are
				those who never tried it enough.”Those of us who have come to make regular use of prayer would no more do without it than we would refuse air, food, or sunshine. And for the same reason. When we refuse air, light, or food, the body
				suffers. And when we turn away from meditation and prayer, we likewise deprive our minds, our emotions, and our intuitions of vitally needed support. As the body can fail its purpose for lack of nourishment, so can the soul. We all
				need the light of
				God’s reality, the nourishment of His strength, and the at-mosphere of His grace. To an amazing extent the facts of A.A. life confi rm this ageless truth.There is a direct linkage among self-examination, medi-tation, and prayer. Taken
				separately, these practices can bring much relief and benefi t. But when they are logically related and interwoven, the result is an unshakable founda-tion for life. Now and then we may be granted a glimpse of that ultimate reality
				which is God’s kingdom. And we will be comforted and assured that our own destiny in that realm will be secure for so long as we try, however falter-ingly, to fi nd and do the will of our own Creator.As we have seen, self-searching is
				the means by which we bring new vision, action, and grace to bear upon the dark and negative side of our natures. It is a step in the develop-ment of that kind of humility that makes it possible for us to receive God’s help. Yet it is
				only a step. We will want to go further.We will want the good that is in us all, even in the worst of us, to fl ower and to grow. Most certainly we shall need bracing air and an abundance of food. But fi rst of all we shall want
				sunlight; nothing much can grow in the dark. Meditation is our step out into the sun. How, then, shall we meditate?The actual experience of meditation and prayer across the centuries is, of course, immense. The world’s libraries and
				places of worship are a treasure trove for all seekers. It is to be hoped that every A.A. who has a religious con-nection which emphasizes meditation will return to the practice of that devotion as never before. But what about
				rest of us who, less fortunate, don’t even know how to begin?Well, we might start like this. First let’s look at a really good prayer. We won’t have far to seek; the great men and women of all religions have left us a wonderful
				supply. Here let us consider one that is a classic.Its author was a man who for several hundred years now has been rated as a saint. We won’t be biased or scared off by that fact, because although he was not an alcoholic he did, like
				us, go through the emotional wringer. And as he came out the other side of that painful experience, this prayer was his expression of what he could then see, feel, and wish to become:“Lord, make me a channel of thy peace—that where
				there is hatred, I may bring love—that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness—that where there is discord, I may bring harmony—that where there is error, I may bring truth—that where there is doubt, I may bring
				faith—that where there is despair, I may bring hope—that where there are shadows, I may bring light—that where there is sadness, I may bring joy. Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted—to understand, than
				to be understood—to love, than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one fi nds. It is by for-giving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life. Amen.”As beginners in meditation, we might now reread
				this prayer several times very slowly, savoring every word and trying to take in the deep meaning of each phrase and idea. It will help if we can drop all resistance to what our friend

				“Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.”THE joy of living is the theme of A.A.’s Twelfth Step, and action is
				its key word. Here we turn outward toward our fel-low alcoholics who are still in distress. Here we experience the kind of giving that asks no rewards. Here we begin to practice all Twelve Steps of the program in our daily lives so
				that we and those about us may fi nd emotional sobriety. When the Twelfth Step is seen in its full implication, it is really talking about the kind of love that has no price tag on it.Our Twelfth Step also says that as a result of
				practic-ing all the Steps, we have each found something called a spiritual awakening. To new A.A.’s, this often seems like a very dubious and improbable state of affairs. “What do you mean when you talk about a ‘spiritual awakening’?”
				they ask.Maybe there are as many defi nitions of spiritual awak-ening as there are people who have had them. But certainly each genuine one has something in common with all the others. And these things which they have in common are
				not too hard to understand. When a man or a woman has a spiritual awakening, the most important meaning of it is that he has now become able to do, feel, and believe that
				which he could not do before on his unaided strength and resources alone. He has been granted a gift which amounts to a new state of consciousness and being. He has been set on a path which tells him he is really going somewhere, that
				life is not a dead end, not something to be endured or mastered. In a very real sense he has been transformed, because he has laid hold of a source of strength which, in one way or another, he had hitherto denied himself. He fi nds
				himself in possession of a degree of honesty, toler-ance, unselfi shness, peace of mind, and love of which he had thought himself quite incapable. What he has received is a free gift, and yet usually, at least in some small part, he
				has made himself ready to receive it.A.A.’s manner of making ready to receive this gift lies in the practice of the Twelve Steps in our program. So let’s consider briefl y what we have been trying to do up to this point:Step One
				showed us an amazing paradox: We found that we were totally unable to be rid of the alcohol obsession until we fi rst admitted that we were powerless over it. In Step Two we saw that since we could not restore ourselves to sanity,
				some Higher Power must necessarily do so if we were to survive. Consequently, in Step Three we turned our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. For the time being, we who were atheist or agnostic discovered
				that our own group, or A.A. as a whole, would suffi ce as a higher power. Beginning with Step Four, we commenced to search out the things in ourselves which had brought us to physical, moral, and spiritual bankruptcy. We made a
				searching and fearless moral inventory. Looking at Step Five, we decided that an inventory, taken alone, wouldn’t be enough. We knew we would have to quit the deadly business of living alone with our confl icts, and in honesty confi
				de these to God and another human being. At Step Six, many of us balked—for the practical reason that we did not wish to have all our defects of character re-moved, because we still loved some of them too much. Yet we knew we had to
				make a settlement with the fundamental principle of Step Six. So we decided that while we still had some fl aws of character that we could not yet relinquish, we ought nevertheless to quit our stubborn, rebellious hanging on to them.
				We said to ourselves, “This I cannot do today, perhaps, but I can stop crying out ‘No, never!’” Then, in Step Seven, we humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings such as He could or would under the condi-tions of the day we asked.
				In Step Eight, we continued our house-cleaning, for we saw that we were not only in con-fl ict with ourselves, but also with people and situations in the world in which we lived. We had to begin to make our peace, and so we listed the
				people we had harmed and be-came willing to set things right. We followed this up in Step Nine by making direct amends to those concerned, except when it would injure them or other people. By this time, at Step Ten, we had begun to
				get a basis for daily living, and we keenly realized that we would need to continue taking personal inventory, and that when we were in the wrong we ought to admit it promptly. In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had restored
				us to sanity and had enabled us to live with some peace of mind in a sorely troubled world, then such a Higher Power was worth knowing better, by as
			</p>
			<p>direct contact as possible. The persistent use of meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river which led to sure power and safe guidance from God as we were
				in-creasingly better able to understand Him.So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awaken-ing about which fi nally there was no question. Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubted them-selves, the rest of us
				were able to see the change setting in. From great numbers of such experiences, we could predict that the doubter who still claimed that he hadn’t got the “spiritual angle,” and who still considered his well-loved A.A. group the
				higher power, would presently love God and call Him by name.Now, what about the rest of the Twelfth Step? The won-derful energy it releases and the eager action by which it carries our message to the next suffering alcoholic and which
				fi nally translates the Twelve Steps into action upon all our affairs is the payoff, the magnifi cent reality, of Al-coholics Anonymous.Even the newest of newcomers fi nds undreamed rewards as he tries to help his brother alcoholic,
				the one who is even blinder than he. This is indeed the kind of giving that actually demands nothing. He does not expect his brother sufferer to pay him, or even to love him. And then he dis-covers that by the divine paradox of this
				kind of giving he has found his own reward, whether his brother has yet received anything or not. His own character may still be gravely defective, but he somehow knows that God has en-abled him to make a mighty beginning, and he
				senses that

				Problems of money, property, and authority may easily divert us from our primary spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable property of genuine use to A.A. should be separately incorporated and managed, thus dividing
				the material from the spiritual. An A.A. group, as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids to A.A., such as clubs or hospitals which require much prop-erty or administration, ought to be incorporated and so set apart that,
				if necessary, they can be freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to use the A.A. name. Their management should be the sole respon-sibility of those people who fi nancially support them. For clubs, A.A.
				managers are usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as other places of recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A.—and medically supervised. While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought never to go so far
				as affi liation or endorsement, actual or implied. An A.A. group can bind itself to no one.

				The A.A. groups themselves ought to be fully sup-ported by the voluntary contributions of their own mem-bers. We think that each group should soon achieve this ideal; that any public solicitation of funds using the name of Alcoholics
				Anonymous is highly dangerous, whether by groups, clubs, hospitals, or other outside agencies; that ac-ceptance of large gifts from any source, or of contributions carrying any obligation whatever, is unwise. Then, too, we view with
				much concern those A.A. treasuries which con-tinue, beyond prudent reserves, to accumulate funds for no stated A.A. purpose. Experience has often warned us that nothing can so surely destroy our spiritual heritage as fu-tile disputes
				over property, money, and authority.

				Each A.A. group needs the least possible organiza-tion. Rotating leadership is the best. The small group may elect its secretary, the large group its rotating committee, and the groups of a large metropolitan area their central or
				intergroup committee, which often employs a full-time secretary. The trustees of the General Service Board are, in effect, our A.A. General Service Committee. They are the custodians of our A.A. Tradition and the receivers of
				voluntary A.A. contributions by which we maintain our A.A. General Service Offi ce at New York. They are autho-rized by the groups to handle our overall public relations and they guarantee the integrity of our principal newspa-per,
				the A.A. Grapevine. All such representatives are to be guided in the spirit of service, for true leaders in A.A. are but trusted and experienced servants of the whole. They derive no real authority from their titles; they do not
				govern. Universal respect is the key to their usefulness.
